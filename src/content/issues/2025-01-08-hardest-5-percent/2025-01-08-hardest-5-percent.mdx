Hey there!

Welcome to the Broken Comb Newsletter! This is ***the very first*** Broken Comb newsletter that I'm sending out. ü§Ø I'll be honest, I've put off sending this newsletter for ***years***. Mainly because I've put so much pressure on myself to make it meaningful. I get so much spam in my own inbox, that I'd hate to contribute to someone spam in someone else's. I say that because ***I need your help.***

I'm still trying to refine the format and determine out what is the most helpful for *you*. [I put together a survey of topics](https://www.brokencomb.dev/vote). I'd love it if you'd take the time to vote on topics that you want to learn about. Or, even if you'd hit reply to this email and let me know your thoughts: ABC

- **Awesome** - What's great?
- **Boring** - What's unengaging?
- **Confusing** - What's unclear?

I have big plans for 2025. [I'm building 12 projects in 12 months](https://buildtwelve.com). I know. I'm either crazy or brilliant. ü§™¬†

I've been fascinated by creators like Marc Lou and Pieter Levels. Years ago, Pieter challenged himself to build 12 applications in one year. In [his announcement post](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), he talked about two problems: (1) finishing. Most projects are never ‚Äújust done.‚Äù And (2) launching. Each project carries a fear of failure. I feel this. So, like Pieter, I'm embracing a similar challenge to build 12 applications in 12 months.

> It'll be like a tiny personal hyperfast incubator.

You're more than welcome to follow along. I'm documenting everything on [Build Twelve](https://buildtwelve.cmo).

Unlike Pieter, though, I have a full-time job, a mortgage, a family, 3 children, and 2 dogs. **This would not be possible without the help of AI. ‚Äî**  I think that's one of the things that makes this experiment so interesting and the timing so significant. I've heard multiple people predict that the next way of million dollar companies are going to be built by solopreneuers leveraging AI. AI is your CTO, CFO, CMO, and CIO.

I know this scares a lot of people. ‚ÄúAI is coming for our jobs.‚Äù ([AI is coming for our jobs, but not in the way you'd expect.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/ai-is-taking-your-job)) But, personally, I see AI like a calculator. It's a tool that will enable to me to do my jobs faster and better. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be left behind.

So, how am I using AI?

Before I answer that question, let me share some context that changed everything.

Recently, we had Ray Deck on the [Compressed.fm](http://Compressed.fm) podcast.

![]()

Ray founded a community that works on solving the hardest 5% of problems in no code/low code projects. Instead of using AI (or no code / low code) to do the parts that you find easy, leverage AI to do the hard parts. Once the hardest 5% of the project is solved, the project becomes infinitely easier.

Whenever, I've tried to use AI to suggest logos or design marketing pages or handle the product design, I usually walk away frustrated. I already have an idea of what I want and it can be difficult trying to get AI to deliver exactly what I'm looking for. But, for me, design is the part that I love. It's the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù part. It's not my 5%.

Writing, on the other hand, is hard. It has never come naturally to me. I'm sure I could get better with practice. I'm usually proud of the final result, but have never gotten to the point where I enjoy the process.

I'm better at editing, than I am writing. Writing is my 5%. But, this is also where I've found the most gains with AI and where AI has let me play to my strengths.

What is your 5%? Start there! - Maybe you're a junior dev and coding is still hard. Leverage tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com) to not only write code, but explain it as well. Or, maybe design is difficult. Check out [v0](https://v0.dev/), [Figma AI](https://www.figma.com/ai/), or component libraries like [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Make your hard part easy.

## **Tips I've Found when Working with AI**

- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/welcome)¬†and¬†[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)¬†both have prompt guides. They're worth reading.
- Lately, I've been getting better results with¬†[Claude](https://claude.ai/). The responses I was getting from ChatGPT were noticeably AI.
- Break down large tasks into smaller tasks. For example, when I'm writing landing page copy, first I ask it to write an outline that includes all the elements I need. Then, I take element within the outline and ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù it with AI. ‚ÄúWrite 15 different options for a headline for this section.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat, I'm going to use this one ________. Now, suggest 10 different complimentary subheadings.‚Äù ‚ÄúI like these 2 options: _________. Can you merge these two ideas together?‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, write out the copy for this section.‚Äù
- When it comes to writing, I usually ask for several options. This allows me to pick out the best option or Frankenstein something together. (Did you notice in my example?)
- For repetitive tasks, create custom GPTs within ChatGPT. It's surprisingly easy. The editor is a normal chat window where you describe all the things that you want ChatGPT to do. There's also a test panel, where you can test the results. This makes it easy to refine your request and provide ChatGPT with feedback.
- AI is also useful for managing projects: creating plans, developing strategies, looking for blind spots, running a SWOT analysis. Even if the result isn't perfect, it has at least challenged my thinking or gotten me to think in a different direction.
- When you're writing prompts, ask the question last. This feels counter intuitive. As humans, we like to ask the question first so that we can listen for the answer as you provide context. But, with AI, the last thing is the most important thing.
- AI is only as good as its context. The more information you provide, the more accurate and relevant the results will be. ‚Äî In November, [Claude announced a feature called ‚ÄúContext Model Protocol.‚Äù](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) It wills you to expand your context window to your files on your computer, Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, and others. ü§Ø
- The first answer is rarely the best answer. If you don't like the response it gives you, tell it, and tell it¬†*why*¬†you don't like that answer.
- I learn so much by reading other people's prompts. I suggest collecting prompts inside a database, like¬†[Notion](https://www.notion.com/).

The easiest way to get started is to simply start experimenting.

In the same vain as above, My Top Cursor Tips. Well, not my tips, someone else's tips. But, Cursor has quickly become my daily driver. Once I learned that I could @ reference any file in my project for context or include all my open tabs with /Reference Open Editors ü§Ø

Tailwind v4 in Beta
At the end of November, Adam Wathan announced Tailwind v4 in Beta. While v4 is significantly faster, this update included several major changes:

CSS-First Configuration removes the need for a JavaScript configuration file. üò≥ Adam has said that the tailwind.config.ts file will not go away anytime soon, it might disappear in v5.
I really enjoyed reading this write up: Thoughts on Tailwind 4. These days, I use Tailwind on almost all my projects. But, there are a few nuances that drive me crazy (namely, inconsistent sizes). Glad to know, I'm not the only one.
