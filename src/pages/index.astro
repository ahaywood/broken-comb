		<p class="font-bold leading-7 mb-8">Master Web Development: Wide & Deep</p>
		<p>Want to excel in tech? Success requires both breadth and depth – a broad understanding of how everything connects, combined with deep expertise in specific areas. We'll help you achieve both.</p>
		<p><strong>Why "The Broken Comb"?</strong> Picture your journey in web development like a comb with varying teeth lengths. You'll develop a broad foundation of knowledge (the comb's spine), but in areas that matter most to you, you'll go deeper (longer teeth). This natural progression of learning – going both wide and deep – creates a pattern that looks just like a broken comb. It's not broken at all; it's the shape of expertise.</p>
